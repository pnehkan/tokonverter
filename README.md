# Tokonverter
A basis for an app that converts event token prices into more understandable currencies.
This app was made within 3 days as part of a project for the Associate Degree Software Development.

## The idea
Festivals like cryptic currencies that make it hard to discern the real price of their food and drinks.
This app aims to pull away that curtain by converting these token currencies into real currencies.

## Usage
For each event, a currency can be entered after which the menu for each food/drink stand can be entered.
The idea is that this is eventually all done via an API, so that each user can benefit from what other users have already entered.
Now, we can enjoy festivals while also keeping our wallets in check!
